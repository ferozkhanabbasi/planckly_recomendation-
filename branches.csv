It was here that he started trading and laying the foundation for the house of Asgharali. He proved a great sense of inspiration to his son Saleem Asghar Ali, under whose dynamic leadership the Group is growing from strength to strength and establishing and sustaining a leadership position in all its key businesses through continuous value creation.

Asgharali has won the hearts of consumers worldwide and laid its footprint in the perfumery market and related business interests with over 100 retail and franchise outlets and stores in the Middle East and South Asia and over 40 distributors worldwide in regions from Eastern Europe to South America.

The company is poised for continuous exponential growth with the development of partnerships with interested parties for global distribution, franchise and online sales.","2019-03-20 13:30:29","2018-12-11 13:30:29"

It currently accommodates more than 800 worshippers, a number of whom attend from surrounding areas.

We believe that the fundamental purpose of Kingston Mosque is to express the sentiment of the final testament to mankind where the fruits of tawhid – (Abrahamic) Monotheism, birr – righteousness, taqwa – God consciousness, ihsan – striving for perfection and makarim’l akhlaq – ethics of the highest order are evident for all to see.

As Muslims we strive to be part of a greater cause, and in aspiring to the perfect example of the Prophet we recognise the need for a centre from where righteousness, learning and activism emanate, as it did from the Prophetic Mosque.

This centre seeks to serve as a hub in the south west area of London for the wider Muslim community, built on cogent Islamic practice that meets the contemporary intellectual, spiritual and social needs of British Muslims and wider society.

Rather than construct another prayer facility, the centre should provide Muslims with many of the institutional needs that have been neglected. This goes beyond pastoral community support to real scholastic advice and direction, deep conservative spiritual cultivation, educational support (both religious and secular), outreach work, spreading the Abrahamic message to wider society and educating the British public on Islamic beliefs and ethics.

The Muslim community has long required a space in which it can be comfortable, both religiously and socially – a hub where believers can actively participate in their own development and encourage the growth of others. Increasing levels of religiosity have rather unfortunately not seen the needed increase in resources to cater for it, and so the British Muslim community has been unable to conceptualise a cogent expression of faith in modern society and frame its own unique identity.

The community of believers should seek to positively impact wider society through their social and religious activism, engendering civility, courteousness, sagacity, fairness, sincerity, trustworthiness, and principled resolve. Our work with western Islamic scholars, thinkers, educators, activists and social workers will help to produce a constructive way forward that cogently conceptualises all of the good that God calls us to.","2019-03-20 19:23:29","2019-05-08 19:30:29"
